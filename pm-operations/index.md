# PBA - Privilege Manager Operations

Once you have setup Privilege Manager and Privileged Behavior Analytics to work together, you will begin normal operations. During a typical session with PBA, you will use various tools, including the quick navigation tiles and drop-down menu item tools summarized in the table below.

>**Note**: If you are already using PBA for Secret Server, select the Privilege Manager Analytics menu. If you are using PBA for Privilege Manager only, your Privilege Manager Analytics Dashboard opens by default.
