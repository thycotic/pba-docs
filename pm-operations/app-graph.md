# Application Graph

You are looking at a graph of Privilege Manager event data. The graph starts out showing clusters or "communities", which are a high-level organization of the nodes. The expanded view shows circles or "nodes", which represent Users and Applications. The lines or "links" show the number of events between Users and Applications.

The "Filter by selected" input accepts "*" (wildcard) and uppercase "AND", "NOT", and "OR" searches (but no mixing AND, NOT, OR, nor parentheses).

All metadata are based on the latest update (even for past timeframes).

Timestamps are based on the Local Timezone in System Settings.

>**NOTE**: if no nodes appear, go to the Filters menu and try turning off filters.
