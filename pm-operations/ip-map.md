Click an individual point (circle without a number) to see details for an IP address. Points with a gray or black outline are located only to the region or country level, respectively.

Zoom in/out using the mouse wheel, buttons on the upper left, double-click (+ Shift), or drag the mouse while holding Shift to draw a box.

The "Filter by selected" input accepts "*" (wildcard) and uppercase "AND", "NOT", and "OR" searches (but no mixing AND, NOT, OR, nor parentheses).

All metadata are based on the latest update (even for past timeframes).

Timestamps are based on the Local Timezone in System Settings.

>**NOTE**: if no data appear, go to the Filters menu and try turning off filters.

## Disclaimers

IP address locations are prone to change and can be inaccurate and imprecise, sometimes located to only the region or country level. This app shows only the most recent available IP address location information, which might have been updated since the time an IP address was last accessed. Location data are derived from MaxMind's GeoLite2.
