# PBA Operations

Once you have setup Secret Server and Privileged Behavior Analytics to work together, you will begin normal operations. During a typical session with PBA, you will use various of its tools, including:

* **Dashboard**: all of your key indicators, neatly assembled
* **Secret Access Graph**: visual representations of data about access to secrets, designed to reveal patterns against which non-normative access will stand out
* **Privileged Behavior Alerts**: alerts issued by PBA based on observed variances from typical secret access patterns, according to thresholds you set; includes current alerts and access to retired alerts
* **User Watch List**: assembles information about users whose activity accessing secrets has attracted your specific scrutiny
* **Secret Access Clock**: visualizes the overall rate of secrets activity over time
* **Most Active Secrets**: reveals what secrets have seen the most access and by whom
* **Most Active Users**: identifies users who are accessing more secrets than most other users
* **Secret Details**: runs down all recent access activity for a specific secret as well as the characteristics of the secret
* **User Details**: allows you to explore in detail information that may be collected about a specific userâ€™s activity over time

The rest of this section details these tools.
