# PBA - Secret Server Operations

Once you have setup Secret Server and Privileged Behavior Analytics to work together, you will begin normal operations. During a typical session with PBA, you will use various tools, including:

* **Dashboard**: all of your key indicators, neatly assembled
* **Privileged Behavior Alerts**: alerts issued by PBA based on observed variances from typical Secret access and Admin action patterns, according to thresholds you set; includes current alerts and access to retired alerts
* **User Watch List**: assembles information about users whose activity accessing Secrets has attracted your specific scrutiny
* **Secret Event Clock**: visualizes the overall rate of Secret activity over time
* **Secret Event Graph**: visual representations of data about access to Secrets, designed to reveal patterns against which non-normative access will stand out
* **Secret Event IP Map**: visualizes Secret activity on a map, aggregated by IP address and location
* **Most Active Secrets**: reveals which Secrets have seen the most access and by whom
* **Most Active Users**: identifies users who are accessing more Secrets than most other users
* **Mobile Cache**: visualizes users that have performed a mobile cache on Secrets
* **Admin Actions**: similar to Secret Events, these pages include a Clock, Graph, IP Map, and Most Active Admins and Actions for administrator activity
* **Secret Details**: runs down all recent access activity for specific Secrets as well as the characteristics of the Secret
* **User Details**: allows you to explore in detail information that may be collected about a specific userâ€™s activity over time
* **IP Address Details**: for Secret Server instances that record various user IP addresses this shows IP activity trends and location information

The rest of this section details these tools.
