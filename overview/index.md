# Overview

Privileged Behavior Analytics works with your Secret Server to improve the security of your enterprise systems by helping to **visualize**, **detect**, **interrupt**, and **announce** threatening activity and behavior across your IT infrastructure.

* **visualize**: by applying algorithms to Secret Server log files, PBA visualizes data relationships to help your staff recognize and respond to security threats
* **detect**: PBA learns patterns of activity—‘behaviors’—associated with security threats and continuously monitors for such threat indicators
* **interrupt**: by mounting **Access Challenges** of several types, PBA automatically interrupts concerning behaviors
* **announce**: as it detects possible threats, PBA uses several contact methods to notify appropriate staff
