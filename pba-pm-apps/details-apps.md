The Application Details page lists all applications and includes summary statistics and links to further details.  The "No Policy" checkbox is on by default and shows only applications without a policy applied.  Uncheck to see all applications.

If you click on any of the application names or file hashes you will be directed to that entityâ€™s details page, which shows the following:

* **App Stats**: lists key statistics such as total number of events and users, time range, and last event action
