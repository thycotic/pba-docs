# Secret Server Configuration

Secret Server provides data to Privileged Behavior Analytics through the **Data Uploader**, which requires version-dependent configuration.

Other significant setup focus areas include:

* configuring for **proxied environments**
* import of **historical data**
* setting up the **Background Worker** (clustered environments)
