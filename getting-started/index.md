# Getting Started

To get started using Privileged Behavior Analytics:

1. Make sure you have the [required](requirements.md) Secret Server version.
1. [Configure Secret Server](secret-server-config.md).
1. [Configure PBA](pba-config.md)
1. Set up [Single Sign-On](single-sign-on.md)
1. Set up [Access Challenges](access-challenges.md)

Privileged Behavior Analytics resides on the Amazon AWS platform as a Cloud application. To use PBA requires no hardware installation and no COTS installation on your premises.

However, it does require that you configure Secret Server to send metadata to Privileged Behavior Analytics, and this process is version-dependent.

This articles in this section detail the required setup.
