# Getting Started

Privileged Behavior Analytics resides on the Amazon AWS platform as a Cloud application. To use PBA requires no hardware installation and no COTS installation on your premises.

However, it does require that you configure Secret Server to send metadata to Privileged Behavior Analytics, and this process is highly version-dependent.

This articles in this section detail the required setup.
