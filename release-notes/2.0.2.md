# 2.0.2 Release Notes

## Enhancements

* User Watch List
  * added a User Watch List page to help admins keep a closer eye on key users and provide a centralized starting point to dive into analytics. By default, the Watch List automatically adds users with open alerts or warnings as well as new users
  * can manually add users to User Watch List with customizable notes and reasons (e.g. "Departing User, Suspicious"); to enable quick action, each user's entry includes links to their PBA Details' page, Active Alerts, and the Secret Server User Edit page
* Webhook Response Actions
  * now PBA can send alert data to a web endpoint, such as ServiceNow or Slack, to make responding to an alert easier; PBA can also run a script to execute additional actions not possible with a webhook, for example, a Codehook can be configured in PBA to take actions (e.g. locking accounts of a user with suspicious activity) in any combination of systems including Human Resources, Security, Identity, or Workflow
* Email Enhancements
  * redesigned Alert Emails include details of each alert or warning along with links to take immediate action like **Investigate**, **Dismiss**, or **View User Activity**
  * the PBA alerting system can now trigger faster alerts, so admins will know within moments whether a user is acting out of the ordinary
* UI Updates
  * pages for User Details and Secret Details pages are enhanced with new statistics boxes that show key information and action links
